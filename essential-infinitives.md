# Infinitives

Infinitives are _verbals_, like _participles_, but instead of adjectives they act as nouns.  So while _infinitives_ are built on a verb they function like a noun and can take on the role of subject or object in a sentence.  An _infinitive_ can also be a **complementary** verb, completing the meaning of another verb.  Infinitives are also used in **indirect statements**.

| | Active | Passive |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Present <br /> (same time) | 2nd principle part <br /> -**āre**, -**ēre**, -**ere**, -**īre** <br /> to *verb* |  2nd principle part ending in -**ī** <br /> -**ārī**, -**ērī**, -**ī**, -**īrī** <br /> to be *verb*ed | 
| Perfect <br /> (time before)  | 3rd principle part <br /> perfect active stem + -**isse** <br /> to have *verb*ed | 4th principle part <br /> perfect passive participle + **esse** <br /> to have been *verb*ed |
| Future <br /> (time after) | 4th principle part <br /> future active participle [+ **esse**] <br /> to be going to *verb* | 4th principle part <br /> accusative supine + **īrī** <br /> to be going to be *verb*ed |

An **indirect statement** simply reports indirectly (not in direct quotation) what someone has said, thought, felt, etc.  An **infinitive** with its subject in the **accusative** case is used in **indirect statement** after verbs of knowing, thinking, telling, and perceiving (head verbs).

After any tense of the main verb the present, perfect, or future tense of the infinitive may be used.  As with participles, the tenses of the infinitive are relative, not absolute.

- the _present infinitive_ indicates the _same time as_ that of the main verb
- the _perfect infinitive_ indicates _time before_ that of the main verb
- the _future infinitive_ indicates _time after_ that of the main verb
