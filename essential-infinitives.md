# Infinitives

Infinitives are _verbals_, like _participles_, but instead of adjectives they act as nouns.  So while _infinitives_ are built on a verb they function like a noun and can take on the role of subject or object in a sentence.  An _infinitive_ can also be a **complementary** verb, completing the meaning of another verb.  Infinitives are also used in **indirect statements**.
