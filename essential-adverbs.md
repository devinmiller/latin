# The Absolute Essentials of Adverbs

This page should include basic patterns to memorize.

## Formation and Comnparison of Adverbs

Many adverbs have peculiar forms or endings and must be memorized.

### Positive Degree

A great many adverbs, however, are formed directly from adjectives and are easy to recognize.

#### 1st/2nd Declension

The positive degree of adverbs can be formed from 1st/2nd declension adjectives by adding **-ē** to the base ending.

#### 3rd Declension

Adverbs are often formed form 3rd declension adjectives by adding **-iter** to the base; if the base ends in **-nt-** only **-er** is added.

### Comparative and Superlative Degree

The comparative degree of adverbs is, with a few exceptions, identiclel to the **-ius** form of the comparative degree of neuter adjectives.

The superlative degree of adverbs is derived from the superlative degree of adjectives by adding **-ē** to the base ending.

### Quam with Comparative and Superlative Adverbs

**Quam** is used with adverbs in the same ways as with adjectives.
