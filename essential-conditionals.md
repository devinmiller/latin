# Conditional Sentences

Latin has 4 types of sentences: declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, and conditional.

- Declarative sentences communicate **statements**
- Interrogative sentences communicate **questions**
- Exclamatory sentences communicate **questions**
- Conditional sentences communicate an **action that is dependent up (a condition of) another action**

Conditional sentences consist of two clauses -

1. the condition (**protasis**)
1. the conclusion (**apodosis**)

The _protasis_ is a subordinate clause usually introduced by **sÄ«**, _if_, or **nisi**, _if...not, unless_, stating a hypothetical action or circumstance.

The _adoposis_ is the main clause which expresses the anticipated outcome if hte premise turns out to be true.

There are six basic conditional types, three have verbs in the indicative, and three in the subjunctive.

## Indicative conditions

| Past Simple Fact | Perfect/Imperfect Indicative | Perfect/Imperfect Indicative | Translate verbs as past indicatives (according to context): <br /> "If he did this, he was wise." |
