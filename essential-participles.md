# Participles

While not as common in English as in Latin, participles are _verbial adjectives_.  Participles share in the characteristics of both adjectives and verbs.  

As _adjectives_ participles agree in case, number, and gender with the nouns they modify.  Sometimes, like _adjectives_, they modify no expressed noun but function as nouns themselves.  

As _verbs_, participles have tense and voice; they may take direct objects or other constructions used with the particular verb; and they may be modified by an adverb or adverbial phrase.

| | Active | Passive |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Present| _present_ stem + -**ns** (_gen._ -**ntis**) <br /> *verb*ing | --- |
| Perfect | --- | _participial_ stem + -**us**, -**a**, -**um** <br /> having been *verb*ed, *verb*ed |
| Future | _participial_ stem + -**ūrus**, -**ūra**, -**ūrum** <br /> about/going to *verb* | _present_ stem + -**ndus**, -**nda**, -**ndum** <br /> to be *verb*ed |

The **future perephrastic** is formed by combining the _future active_ participle with a form of _sum, esse_.

- _is_ going to be *verb*
- _was_ going to *verb*
- _will be_ going to *verb*

The **passive periphrastic** is formed by combining the _future passive_ participle with a form of _sum, esse_.

- is to be *verb*ed, must be *verb*ed
- _had_ to be *verb*ed
- _will have_ to be *verb*

The _future passive_ participle is commonly referred to as the _gerundive_.  The **gerundive of obligation** denoted obligation or necessity.

- _must_ be *verb*ed
- _is_ to be *verb*ed

An **ablative absolute** is often a _noun_ and a _participle_ (though not always) in the ablative case, with no preposition and grammatically separate from the sentence.

- translated literally "with [noun] [participle]"
- usually shows time or circumstance of an action
- also can show cause, concession, condition, means, or manner
- the _noun_ is detached from the rest of the sentence

The **dative of agent** is used with the **passive periphrastic**/**gerundive** to show who must do the action.
