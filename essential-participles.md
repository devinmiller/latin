# Participles

While not as common in English as in Latin, participles are _veribial adjectives_.  Becuase they decribe nouns they share the noun's case, number, and gender.

| | Active | Passive |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Present| _present_ stem + -**ns** (_gen._ -**ntis**) <br /> *verb*ing | --- |
| Perfect | --- | _participial_ stem + -**us**, -**a**, -**um** <br /> having been *verb*ed, *verb*ed |
| Future | _participial_ stem + -**ūrus**, -**ūra**, -**ūrum** <br /> about/going to *verb* | _present_ stem + -**ndus**, -**nda**, -**ndum** <br /> to be *verb*ed |

The **future perephrastic** is formed by combining the _future active_ participle with a form of _sum, esse_.

- _is_ going to be *verb*
- _was_ going to *verb*
- _will be_ going to *verb*

The **passive perephrastic** is formed by combining the _future passive_ participle with a form of _sum, esse_.

- is to be *verb*ed, must be *verb*ed
- _had_ to be *verb*ed
- _will have_ to be *verb*

The _future passive_ participle is commonly referred to as the _gerundive_.  The **gerundive of obligation** denoted obligation or necessity.

- _must_ be *verb*ed
- _is_ to be *verb*ed
