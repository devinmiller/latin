# Uses of the Ablative Case

The various rules and use cases of the ablative case.

## Rules

The ablative case is an umbrella for three big function:

1. Separation (_from_)
1. Instrument (_by, with_)
1. Location (_in, on, at_)

### Ablative of Means/Instrument

The ablative case is used to show the means or instrument of an action.  Usually this is translated with by, with, or by means of.

### Ablative of Agent

The doer of a passive verb is identified by the preposition ab or ā followed by the ablative case.

Can also use the preposition **per** + accusative to show means of agent.

### Ablative of Means vs Ablative of Agent

| ablative of agent | ablative of means |
| --- | --- |
| mīles **ab hoste** vulnerātus est | mīles **gladiō** vulnerātus est |
| separative function | instrumental function |
| requires **ab**/**ā** | no preposition |
| used with people as the agent | used with inanimate objects |

### Ablative of Accompaniment

Accompaniment, such as who a person is traveling with, is indicated by the preposition _cum_ and the ablative.

When _cum_ is used with a personal, reflexive, or relative pronoun it is regularly placed after the pronoun as an enclitic.

### Ablative of Manner

Manner, how an action is done, is expressed by the ablative case, usually with the preposition _cum_.

When there is adjective with the ablative, Latin likes to omit the _cum_ preposition.

### Ablative of Place from Which

Describes active motion away from a place. Nouns, either proper or common, are almost always used in this sense with accompanying prepositions ab/ā/abs

Describes active motion away from a place.  Regularly involves a verb of active motion from one place to another; nearly always, too, the ablative is governed by one of the prepositions _ab_, _dē_, or _ex_.

### Ablative of Separation

Implies only that some person or thing is separate from another; there is no movement from one place to another; and sometimes there is no preposition, particularly with certain verbs meaning “to free,” “to lack,” and “to deprive,” which commonly take an ablative of separation
