Implies only that some person or thing is separate from another; there is no movement from one place to another; and sometimes there is no preposition, particularly with certain verbs meaning “to free,” “to lack,” and “to deprive,” which commonly take an ablative of separation


### Ablative of Place Where

Typically with **in**, *in/on*, or **sub**, *under*, describing where someone or something is located or an action is occurring.
