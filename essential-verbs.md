# Essential Verbs

When I actually have somewhere to host it, I'll include a link to a master table of verb conjugations.

## Transitive and Intransitive

A _transitive_ verb is a verb that requires a direct object to receive the action.

An _intransitive_ verb is one that **does not** take a direct object.  However, other information, such as _adverbs_ or _prepositions_ maybe present after the verb.

Some verbs can be both _transitive_ and _intransitive_ depending on the context.

## Principle Parts

In Latin, verbs typically have four principal parts.

1. 1st person singular present active indicative
1. present active infinitive
1. 1st person singular perfect active indicative
1. 1st person masculine singular perfect passive indicative

## Deponent Verbs

Deponent verbs are those that have passive endings buy active meanings.  

### Principle Parts and Conjugation

Deponent verbs only have three principal parts, the passive equivalents of the first three principal parts of regular verbs.

### Participles, Infinitives, and Imperatives

Three of the participles and one of the infinitives present exceptions to the rule that deponents are passive in for but active in meaning:

1. Present and future participles: active forms with active meanings.
1. Gerundive (future passive participle): passive from with passive meaning.
1. Future infinitive: active form with active meaning.

## Semi-Deponent Verbs

There are a few semi-deponent verbs, which are normal in the present system but deponent in the perfect system.
