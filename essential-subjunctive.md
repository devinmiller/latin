# Subjective Tense

Used to show actions that are either unreal, not true, of a general circumstance, hypothetical, possible (but not quite real) or  hoped for (but may or may not come true)

## Main Clauses

These are the instances where the subjunctive is used in main clause, making up the sentence entirely.

### Jussive/Hortatory

Used to express a mild command or exhortation, i.e. _let_ us go to the movie, especially in the first or third person.

Easily recognized since the sentence's main, and often only, verb is in the subjunctive.

### Potential

Show a possibility where the future is still unclear, i.e. We _could_ go to the movies.

### Optative

Denotes a wish, i.e. I _wish_ we could go to the movies.

### Deliberative (Question)

Questions that reflect doubt, or even an impossibility, i.e. _Should_ we go to he movies?

## Dependent Clauses

Most often where the subjunctive is encountered, not the main action but a subordinate action.

### Purpose

A subordinate clause indicating the objective of the action in the main clause.  Answers the question "why is (was) it being done?".

Purpose Clauses explain the hypothetical purpose for a given action. There is a main verb in the indicative and a clause marked by an ut or a ne followed by a verb in the subjunctive.

### Result

A subordinate clause that shows the result of the action in the main clause.  Answers the question "what is (was) the outcome?".

A result clause tells the hypothetical result of a particular circumstance. It starts with an adverb of quantity (such as tam or tantus) and a main verb in the indicative. The clause is marked with an ut or an ut non followed by a subjunctive verb.

### Indirect Questions

A subordinate clause the  which reports a question indirectly, not in a direct quotation.

An Indirect Question is a type of subjunctive clause that reports a question asked. It contains a main indicative verb that is a verb of questioning, a question word to introduce the dependent clause, and a subordinate verb in the subjunctive.

### Cum Clauses

A Cum Clause is a subordinate clause that starts with "cum" and contains a subjunctive. There are three types of Cum clauses. The translation of the cum changes depending on the context of the clause:

- Cum Temporal: cum translated as "when" or "after"
- Cum Circumstantial: cum translated as "when" or "after"
- Cum Concessive: cum translated as "although"
- Cum Causal: cum translated as "because" or "since"

#### Cum Temporal

A _cum clause_ with a past tense indicative verb identifies or defines the time at which the action of the main clause occurs.

#### Cum Circumstantial

A _circumstantial cum clause_ has an imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive verb and shows the circumstances that accompanied the action of the main clause.

#### Cum Causal and Concessive

A _causal cum clause_ and _concessive cum clause_ both take verbs in the subjunctive mood.
