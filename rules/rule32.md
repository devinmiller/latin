# Rule 32: The Double Dative and Dative of Purpose

The dative case can show _purpose_, often when it's coupled with a _dative of reference_ in the _double dative_ construction.

The double dative consists of:

verb (often sum, esse) + _DoP_ (purpose) + **DoR** (reference)

The order of the datives doesn't really matter.

DoP - blue
DoR - yellow

> tertiam aciem  **nostrīs** _subsidiō_ mīsit

he sent the third line _to help_ **our men**

> _magnō ūsuī_ **nostrīs** fuit

it was _a great benefit_ **to our men**

> tua pietas **nōbīs** plānē _auxiliō_ fuit

your affection cleary was _a help_ **to us**

In these uses the dative of purpose is used to show the end result of the situation for the dative of reference.

subsidiō = end result
nostrīs = receiver of the result

auxiliō = end result
nōbīs = receiver of the result
