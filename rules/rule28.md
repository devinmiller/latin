# Rule 28: The Dative of Possession

The _dative_ case is used with sum, esse to show _possession_.

> *est* **mihi** domī pater

literally:

_there is **to me** a father at home_

translated:

_**I** have a father at home_

The dative of possession assumes the role of the subject and the est becomes a _have_.

> **illī** stellātus ensis *erat*

literally:

_There was **to him** a glittering sword_

translated:

_**he** had a glittering sword_
