# Rule 57: The Ablative Absolute

An _ablative absolute_ consists of a noun and a participle in the ablative case, showing _time or circumstance of an action_.

The _ablative absolute_ is probably one of, if not the, most import pieces of complex grammar in Latin.  It isn't something we have in English and the direct translations feel very _Latin_.


An ablative absolute is a phrase of a _noun_ and a _participle_ (usually) in the ablative case.  It can be literally translated as -

> with {noun} {participle}

> **pāce** cōnfirmātā

_**with peace** established_

That is the _ablative_ part of the ablative absolute.  It shows the time or circumstance of an action.  It is also not grammatically dependent on any word in the rest of the sentence.  That is the _absolute_ part, from **absolūtus**, _detached_.
