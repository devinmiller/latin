# Rule 57: The Ablative Absolute

An _ablative absolute_ consists of a noun and a participle in the ablative case, showing _time or circumstance of an action_.

The _ablative absolute_ is probably one of, if not the, most import pieces of complex grammar in Latin.  It isn't something we have in English and the direct translations feel very _Latin_.


An ablative absolute is a phrase of a _noun_ and a _participle_ (usually) in the ablative case.  It can be literally translated as -

> with {noun} {participle}

> **pāce** cōnfirmātā

_**with peace** established_

That is the _ablative_ part of the ablative absolute.  It shows the time or circumstance of an action.  It is also not grammatically dependent on any word in the rest of the sentence.  That is the _absolute_ part, from **absolūtus**, _detached_.

## Basic Examples

> Caesar, *acceptīs* **litterīs**, nūntium mittit

_Caesar, **with the letter** received, sends a messenger_

The following translation would also work in this instance for the _ablative absolute_.

- **after the letter** _was received_
- **when the letter** _was received_
- **since the letter** _was received_
- **the letter** _received_

> **agmine** *factō*, fūcōs ā praesēpibus arcent

_with a battle line formed, they keep the drones away from the hive_

Shows the general time circumstance of the drones defending the hive.

> **Caesare** *interfectō*, Brūtus pugiōnem altē extollit

_**with Caesar** killed, Brutus lifts high his dagger_

Shows the circumstance that precedes the raising of the dagger.  

The previous examples used the _perfect passive participle_, which is the most common with this construction, but other participles can be used.

> **paucīs** *dēfendentibus*, oppidum expugnāre nōn potuit

_**with just a few (people)** defending, he was not able to take the town_

## Without a Participle

A participle isn't required, and an ablative absolute can often be found with another noun or adjective.

> **exiguā parte** aestātis **reliquā**

_**with a small part** of the summer **remaining**_

Theses constructions without a participle exist because we really want to use _being_ which really doesn't exist in Latin, so the _being_ is understood in translation.

_**with a small part** of the summer (being) **left** (remaining)_

## Used as an Adverb

Sometimes a participle or adjective can be used as an adverb without an accompanying noun.  This is an extension of the _ablative absolute_.

> consultō

_deliberately/purposefully_

or literally

_with consultation having taken place_

> lībātō

_after a libation has been made_

> serēnō

_with it being clear_

These are effectively adverbs.

## Absoluteness

It is almost always the case that the noun in the ablative absolute is not referred to elsewhere in the sentence.

> **urbe** *captā*, domum redūcō exercitum

_**with the city** captured, I am leading my army home_

Here the city is not playing an important part in the rest of the sentence.  However, there are exception to this rule, done to place greater emphasis on the action in the _ablative absolute_.

## Uses

The ablative absolute can show a lot of different things.

- as a general time relationship
- showing cause
- as a concession
- as a condition
- showing means
- showing manner

### As a General Time Relationship

> **patre** *interfectō*, domum rediit

_**when his father** has been killed, he returned home_

### Showing Cause

> **mercātōribus** iniūriōsius *tractātīs*, bella gessērunt

_**since (because) their merchants** had been treated somewhat badly, they waged war_

### As a Concession

> at **Clōdiō** *repugnante*, Milō fiēbat consul

_but **although Clodius** was opposing, Milo was made consul_

### As a Condition

> praetūra dēbilis esset, **Milōne** consule

_The praetor would be weak, **with Milo** as consul_

or

_The praetor would be weak, **if Milo** were consul_

### Showing Means

> flūmen **ratibus** iunctīs transībant

_they were crossing the river, **with rafts** joined together_

### Showing Manner

> incitātō **equō** sē hostibus obtulit

_he rushed upon the enemy **with his horse** spurred on_
