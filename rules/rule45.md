# Rule 45: The Ablative of Comparison

The ablative case can be used following a _comparative_, signifying _than_.

The comparative degree of adjectives is used to illustrate a comparison between two different objects.  

For example, to compare the wide of the Nile river to the Rhine.  There are two options.

Using quam.

> Nīlus est lātior **quam Rhēnus**

Using an ablative.

> Nīlus est lātior **Rhēnō**

Both have the same meaning.

_the Nile is wider **than the Rhine**_

> Catō est **Cicerōne** ēloquentior

_Cato is more eloquent **than Cicero**_

> quid **nōbīs duōbus** labōriōsius est?

_What is more troublesome **than we two**?_

The ablative of comparison can only be used with nouns in the _nominative_ or _accusative_ case.  

> fīliae maiorem laudem dedī **quam fīliō**

_I gave greater praise to my daughter **than to my son**_
