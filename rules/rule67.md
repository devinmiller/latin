# Rule 67: The Infinitive as a Subject

The infinitive can serve as the _subject_ of _est_ or other similar verbs.

The infinitive is technically a noun that represents an action.

As a noun:

- can be a subject
- can be an object

As an action:

- has a tense
- has a voice
- modified by adverbs
- can take an object
- only used in certain circumstances

## Subjective Infinitive

> **errāre** est hūmānum

_**to err** is human_

The infinitive **errāre** is functioning as the subject of est.  The infinitive is treated as a neuter gender noun. 

> **dolēre** malum est

_**to be in pain** is an evil_

Often looks in English to _not_ be the subject.

> dulce et decōrum est prō patriā **morī**

_It is sweet and propert **to die** for your country_

or

_**Dying** for your country is sweet and proper_

English tends to use the _gerund_ form where Latin loves the _infinitive_.  

> praestat **compōnere** fluctūs

_It is better **to calm** the waves_

or 

_**Calming** the waves is better_
