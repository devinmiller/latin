# Rule 44: The Ablative of Agent

The _doer_ of a _passive verb_ is identified by the preposition _ab_ or _ā_ followed by the ablative case.

> mīles vulnerātus est **ab hoste**

_the solder was wounded **by the enemy**_

> laudātur **ab hīs**, culpātur **ab illīs**

_he is praised **by these**, blamed **by those**_

The preposition _ab_ retains the _b_ when the following noun begins in a **vowel** or **h**, but becomes a long _ā_ when the following noun begins in a **consonant**.

With passive verbs we often find an ablative of means/instrument instead of an ablative of agent.  

| ablative of agent | ablative of means |
| --- | --- |
| mīles **ab hoste** vulnerātus est | mīles **gladiō** vulnerātus est |
| separative function | instrumental function |
| requires **ab**/**ā** | no preposition |
| used with people as the agent | used with inanimate objects |

Can also use the preposition per + accusative to show means of agent.

> **per Hannibalem** bellum illātum est

_was was waged **by Hannibal**_

The dative of agent is also used to show the agent with gerundives of obligation, also known as the passive pereiphrastic.

> **nōbīs** ūna nox dormienda est

_one night must be slept **by us**_
