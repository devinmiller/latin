# Rule 19: The Genitive of the Whole

The _genitive of the whole_ (partitive genitive) often follows words that denote a part.

## With nouns and pronouns

> pars **urbis**

_part **of the city**_

The city doesn't possess the part, it is the whole.  

> quis **nostrum**

_who **of us**_

> nēmō **eōrum**

_no one **of them**_

> nihil **reliquī**

_nothing **of what remains**_

or

_nothing **left**_

The genitive defines the whole, while another noun gives the part.

## with numbers, comparatives, superlatives, and pronominals

> ūnus mīlitum

_one **of the soldiers**_

> pessimus **prīncipum**

_the worst **of the emporers**_

> **hōrum omnium** fortissimī

_the bravest **of all these**_

> mille **passuum**

_a thousand **of paces**_

or 

_a thousand **paces**_

## With neuter adjectives and pronouns

> quid novī

_what **news**?_

literally

_what **of new**?_

> tantum **spatī**

_so much **(of) space**_

> plūs vīnī

_more **(of) wine**_

## With adverbs

Especially with adverbs of quantity or space

> nimium **vīnī**

_too much **(of) wine**_

> satis **pecūniae**

_enough **(of) money**_

> ubinam **gentium** sumus?

_where **in the world** are we?

They key is to not wedge yourself too much to the _of_ translation of the genitive case.
