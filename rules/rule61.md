# Rule 61: The Jussive Subjunctive

The _hortatory_ or _jussive_ subjunctive is used in the present tense to express a _gentle command_, _urging_, or _concession_.

The two terms, jussive and hortatory, are essentially synonymous.  

This is usually translated in English with the word _let_.

> let {subject (in the objective case)} {verb}

For example:

> <span style="color: green;">eāmus</span>

_<span style="color: green">let us go</span>_
