# Rule 61: The Jussive Subjunctive

The _hortatory_ or _jussive_ subjunctive is used in the present tense to express a _gentle command_, _urging_, or _concession_.

The two terms, jussive and hortatory, are essentially synonymous.  

This is usually translated in English with the word _let_.

> let {subject (in the objective case)} {verb}

For example:

> **eāmus**

***let us go***

Even this is 1<sup>st</sup> person plural with the _-mus_ ending, in English we translate it as _let **us**_ rather than using the _subject_ form ***we***.  

> **vīvāmus** atque **amēmus**

_**let us live** and **let us love**_

> **caveant** intemperantiam

In this example note that _caveant_ is 3<sup>rd</sup> person plural, so _let them_ is used in translation.

_**Let them beware of** excess_

> moriēmur inultae, sed **moriāmur**

This example mixes the future tense, _moriēmur_, with the jussive subjunctive, _moriāmur_.

_I will die unavenged, but **let me die**_

## In the Negative

The negative of the jussive utilizes the particle _nē_.

> nē hīc **maneāmus** 

_**let's** not **stay** here_

> nē ex urbe **discēdat**

_**Let her** not **leave** (from) the city_

> cum absit, nē requīrās

_When it is gone, don't **regret** it_

Or more literally

_When it is gone, **let you** not **miss** it_

## With Past Subjunctive Tenses

Sometimes the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive are used to show an obligation in the past that was left undone or unfullfilled.

> potius **docēret** causam nōn esse aequam

In this case _docēret_ is an imperfect subjunctive.  

_He rather **should have shown** that the case was not fair._

> nē **poposcissēs*

Here _poposcissēs_ is in the plurperfect subjunctive.

_**you should** not **have asked**_

## As a Concession

Sometimes the jussive shows a concession.

> **sit** fūr, at est bonus imperātor

_**He may be** a thief, at least he is a good general._

Sometimes the perfect subjunctive is used here as well.

> **fuerit** fūr, at est bonus imperātor

_**Suppose he was** a thief, at least he is a good general._
