# Rule 42: The Ablative of Source/Material

## Ablative of Source

The ablative case is used to show the _source_ from which something comes from, or the material it is made of.

Often used with the prepositions _ab_, _dē_, or _ex_.

> **ab aliquō** sermō oritur

_the conversation begins **from someone**_

> odōrēs **ē flōribus** adflābantur

_the odors were exhaled **from flowers**_

If the source is another person, like a parent, then Latin tends to omit the preposition.

> nātus **aliquō**

_born **from someone**_

> nāte **deā**

_born **from the goddess_

> ēdite **rēgibus**

_descended **from kings**_

In many of these instances the ablative follows a participle.  

Also see preposition used when referring to family member other than the father or mother.

> hic nātus est **ex fratre meō**

_he is the son **of my brother**_

## Ablative of Material

The material an object is made of is put in the ablative case, usually with a preposition.

> templum **dē marmore** pōnam

_I will set up a temple **(made) of marble**_

> antrm **dē cautibus** factum

_a cave made **from rocks**_

> valvae **ex aurō**

_doors **(made) from gold**_

The is a genitive of material that is pretty similar in meaning to the ablative of material.

| ablative of material | genitive of material |
| --- | --- |
| valvae **ex aurō** | valvae **aurī** |

There is not much difference.
