# Rule 43: The Ablative of Cause

The ablative case is used to show the _cause of an action_, with or without a preposition.

Can often use the preposition _because_ in its translation, as well as the preposition _for_.

> **ūtilitāte**, nōn **arte**, laudātur

_it is praised **because of its usefulness**, not **(because of) its skill_

> > **neglegentiā** plectimur

_we are chastised **because of our negligence**_

The ablative of cause can also be found with a preposition.

> mare **ā solē** lucet

_the sea shines **from the sun**_

or 

_the sea shines **because of the sun**_

> aeger **ex vulnere**

_suffering **from a wound**_

Certain verbs expect an ablative of cause.

> ardet **dolōre et **īrā**

_she burns **with grief** and **(with) anger**_

> exciluī **gaudiō**

_I jumped **for joy**_
