# Rule 53: The Ablative of Description

_Description_ is noted by the ablative case _with an adjective_ that modifies it.

Often the ablative case is the _adverbial use_ of the noun.  This was seen in the last rule, [the ablative of the degree of difference](rules52.md).

> **aliquantō** post suspexit

_**a little while** after he looked up_

The ablative _aliquantō_ is functioning here like an adverb.  However, the ablative can function more like an adjective with the _ablative of description/quality_.

> **animō meliōre** sunt gladiātōrēs

_the gladiators are **with a better mind**_

> Aristotelēs est vir **summō ingeniō**, **scientiā**, **cōpiā**

_Aristotle is a man **of the greatest genius**, **learning**, and **ability**_

> Gaius Gracchus, **clārissimō patre**, **avō**, **maiōribus**

_Gaius Gracchus **with a very distinguished father**, **grandfather**, and **ancestors**_

The ablative of description is very similar to the genitive of description.

| ablative of description | genitive of description |
| --- | --- |
| vir **summō ingeniō** | vir **summī ingeniī** |
| more common <br /> physical characteristics | |
