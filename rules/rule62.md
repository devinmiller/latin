# Rule 62: The Optative Subjunctive

The _optative_ subjunctive is used to express a _wish_.

The jussive isn't the only independent use of the subjunctive as a main verb.  

> ita **vīvam**

_**I wish that I would live** in this way (thus)_

Just like with the jussive, the particle _nē_ is used for _negative_ wishes.

> nē ita **vīvam**

_**I wish that I would not live** in this way (thus)_

Often the word _utinam_, translated as _if only, oh that_, precedes the subjunctive verb here.  It is a key clue for use of the optative.  

> utinam mīlitēs **vinat**

_If only the soldiers **would win**_

## With Past Subjunctive Tenses

The optative can also involve the imperfect and pluperfect tenses.  

> utinam nē vērē **scrīberem**

Here the subjunctive is in the _imperfect_ tense.

_If only **I were** not **writing** the truth_

> utinam mē mortuum **vīdissēs**

Here the subjunctive is in the pluperfect tense.

_If only **you had seen** me dead_

| present | imperfect | pluperfect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| possible later | present wish unfulfilled | past wish unfulfilled |
| **vīvam** in urbe | **vīverem** in urbe | vīxissem |
| **If only I would live** in the city | **If only I were living** in the city | **If only I had lived** in the city |

## Velim and Vellem

Sometimes the verb velim (present subjunctive) or vellem (imperfect subjunctive) and verbs like them with an infinitive or subjunctive are used to illustrate the same idea as the optative.

> velim in urbe **vīverēs**

_I should wish **you to live** in the city_

> nollem **accidisset** tempus

_I wish that the time **had** not **happened**_
