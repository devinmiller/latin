# Rule 47: The Ablative of Means/Instrument

The ablative case is used to show the _means_ or _instrument_ of an action.

The ablative is used to show the meaning through which something was done.  Usually this is translated with _by_, _with_, or _by means of_.

> serpēns hōs **morsū** necat

_the serpent kills these men **with his bite**_

> **pugnīs**, **calcibus**, **unguibus** certant

_They fight **with their fists**, **heels**, and **nails**_

> **meīs labōribus** interitū rem pūblicam līberāvī

_I saved the republic from destruction **by my efforts**_

The ablative of means/instrument is also used frequently with words of filling, although the genitive is also used.

> fossam **aggere** explent

_they fill the ditch up **with earth**_

> tōtum montem **hominibus** complēvit

_he filled the whole mountain **with people**_

Verbs in the passive voice often have an ablative of means.

> mīles **gladiō** occīsus est

_the solder was slain **by a sword**_
