# Rule 54: The Ablative of Price

The _price_ of something is put into the ablative case.

> Antōnius regna addīxit **pecūiā**

_Antony sold kingdoms **for money**_

> vectīgālia **parvō pretiō** redempta

_tax collecting bought **for a small price**_

> vēndidit patriam **aurō**

_he sold his country **for gold**_

For prices with a definite value the ablative must be used.

> **dēnāriīs tribus** id aestimāvit

_she valued it **at (to be worth) three denarii

For prices with an indefinite value either the ablative or genitive can be used.

| ablative of price | genitive of value |
| --- | --- |
| **magnō** ēmerat | **magnī** interest |
| _he had bought it **at a high price**_ | _it is **of great consequence**_ |
| quantō, magnō, parvō, minimō | quantī, magnī, parvī, minimī |
| with verbs of _buying_ and _selling_ | (except for _tantī_, _quantī_, _plūris_, _minōris_) |
