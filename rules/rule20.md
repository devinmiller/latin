# Rule 20: The Objective Genitive

Nouns that describe <span style="color: limegreen">_actions_</span> or <span style="color: limegreen">_feelings_</span> take the <span style="color: limegreen">_objective genitive_</span>.

The objective genitive can almost be thought of as the "direct object" of the noun. 

> odium <span style="color: limegreen">Caesaris</span>

_the hatred <span style="color: limegreen">of Caesar</span>_

This is the hatred direct _towards_ or _at_ Caesar.

The following sentences would be equivalent in meaning:

> odium <span style="color: limegreen">Caesaris</span> habeō

_I have a hatred <span style="color: limegreen">for Caesar</span>_

> ōdī <span style="color: cyan">Caesarem</span>

_I hate <span style="color: cyan">Caesar</span>_

The genitive fills the same role as the accusative in these sentences.  Caesar doesn't possess the hatred, he is the object of it.

> dēsīderium <span style="color: limegreen">ōtī</span>

_a longing <span style="color: limegreen">for rest</span>_

> dēsīderō <span style="color: limegreen">ōtium</span>

_I long for <span style="color: limegreen">rest</span>_

Can sometimes get away with using _for_, _to_, or _from_ in the translation.

The key with the objective genitive is seeing it as not possessing the noun, but rather as receiving the action or feeling.  This really depends on context, as the exact same phrase would be used to denote regular possession.
