# Rule 20: The Objective Genitive

Nouns that describe _actions_ or _feelings_ take the _objective genitive_.

The objective genitive can almost be thought of as the "direct object" of the noun. 

> odium **Caesaris**

_the hatred **of Caesar**_

This is the hatred direct _towards_ or _at_ Caesar.

The following two sentences would be equivilent in meaning:

> odium **Caesaris** habeō

_I have a hatred **for Caesar**_

> ōdī **Caesarem**

_I hate **Caesar**_

The genitive fills the same role as the accusative in these sentences.  Caesar doesn't possess the hatred, he is the object of it.

> dēsīderium **ōtī**

_a longing **for rest**_

> dēsīderō **ōtium**

_I long for **rest**_

Can sometimes get away with using _for_, _to_, or _from_ in the translation.

The key with the objective genitive is seeing it as not possessing the noun, but rather as receiving the action or feeling.  This really depends on context, as the exact same phrase would be used to denote regular possession.
