# Rule 12: Nōnne and Num

The word <span style="color: limegreen">_nōnne_</span> introduces a question expecting a "yes" answer, while <span style="color: limegreen">_num_</span> introduces and question expecting a "no" answer.

The expected answer is yes (_sīc_, _ita vērō_):

> <span style="color: limegreen">nōnne</span> ego hīc stō?

_I'm standing here, right?_

Or literally

_Am I not standing here?_

> <span style="color: limegreen">nōnne</span> animadvertis?

_Do you not notice?_

> <span style="color: limegreen">nōnne</span> oppressam rem pūblicam putās?

_Do you not think that the republic has been destroyed?_

The expected answer is no:

> <span style="color: limegreen">num</span> Rōmulus rex barbarōrum fuit?

_Sure Romulus wasn't king of the barbarians, was he?_

> <span style="color: limegreen">num</span> īrātum timēmus Iovem?

_We shouldn't fear angry Jove, should we?_

> <span style="color: limegreen">num</span> ea vēra possumus iūdicāre?

_Surely we cannot judge these things to be true, can we?_

Also, <span style="color: limegreen">num</span> was used in indirect questions, regardless of expectation:

> discipulus quaerēbat <span style="color: limegreen">num</span> Rōmulus rex barbarōrum fuisset

_The student was asking whether Romulus was <span style="color: limegreen">king</span> of the barbarians._
