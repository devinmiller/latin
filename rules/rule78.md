# Rule 78: Relative Clauses of Characteristic

A _relative clause_ with a verb in the subjunctive can indicate a _general characteristic_. 

## quī, quae, quod + subjunctive verb

The subjunctive in a relative clause can also show characteristic, especially when the antececdant is otherwise unknow.

> multa dīcunt **quae vix intellegam**

_They say many theings **which I hardly understand**_

Often clauses of relative characteristic start with these two phrases:

| sunt _quī_ | quis est _quī_ |
| --- | --- |
| there are those _who_ | who is there _who_ |
| sunt _quī Pompeium miserentur_ | quis est _quī linguam Latīnam discere nōlit_ |
| there are those _who pity Pompey_ | who is there _who would not want to learn Latin_ |

> nihil videō **quod timeam**

_I see nothing **which I might fear**_

In these examples, the relative clause is not referring to a specific thing, but to the general concept of the thing.

| relative clause of characteristic | standard relative clause |
| --- | --- |
| **quī, quae, quod** + _subjunctive verb_ | **quī, quae, quod** + _indicative verb_ |
| discipula **quae dīligenter labōret** bene discere potest | discipula **quae dīligenter labōrat** bene discere potest |
| _A student **who is the sort of person to work hard** can learn well_ | _The student **who is working hard** can learn well_ |
| A student characterized by hard work, rather than a student who works hard. | The relative clause is stating something that is true of this student. |
