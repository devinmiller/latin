# Rule 17: The Genitive of Material

The _genitive_ can be used for the _material_ from which something is made, or the _substance_ of which it consists.

> pōculum **aurī**

_a cup **of gold**_

Not a cup filled with gold, but a cup made out of gold.

> casa **stāminis**

_a house **of straw**_

> casa **virgae**

_a house **of twig**_

>casa **lateris**

_a house **of brick**_

Similar in meaning to the _ablative of material_.

| genitive | ablative |
| --- | --- |
| valvae **aurī** | valvae **ex aurō** |
| _a house **of gold**_ | _a house (made) **from gold**_ | 
| templum **marmoris** | templum **dē marmore** | 
| _a temple **of marble**_ | _a temple (made) **from marble**_ |

There isn't much of a difference between the two.
