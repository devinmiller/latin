# Rule 29: The Dative of Agent

The _dative of agent_ is used with the _gerundive_ to show who must do the action

## Gerundive of Obligation

Also known as the _passive periphrastic. 

The gerundive + sum, esse is typically used to show necessity or obligation.

Typically translated with _must_ or _have to_.

> Carthāgō delenda est

_Carthage must be destroyed_

## Dative of Agent

> **nōbīs** Carthāgō delenda est

literally:

_Carthage must be destroyed **by us**_

translated:

_**we** have to/**we** must destroy Carthage_

> haec prōvincia **vōbīs** dēfenda est

literally:

_the province must be defended by **you**_

translated:

_**you** must defend this province_

The dative of agent is sometimes found outside the gerundive of obligation in other passive constructions.

> **mihi** cōnstitūtum est

_it has been settled **by me**_

> neque cernitur **ūllī**

_and he is not seen **by anyone**_

>> sīc **mihi** vidētur

_so it seems **to me**_

## Ablative of Agent

(ab/ā + ablative)

Sometimes used in the passive periphrastic where using a dative would be ambiguous, such as when a dative already exists.
