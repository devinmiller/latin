# Rule 18: The Genitive of Description

The _genitive_ case can be used to _describe_ a characteristic of something, provided that there's an _accompanying adjective_.

The accompanying adjective is absolutely required for this use of the genitive.

> vir **summae virtūtis**

_a man **of highest courage**_

> formīca **magnī labōris**

_an ant **of great toil**_

> mīles **maximī adnimī**

_a soldier **of greatest courage**_

> tempestas **eius modī**

_a storm **of this kind**_

or

_**such** a storm_

The genitive of quality is often seen with nouns modified by

- eius
- magnus, -a, -um
- maximus, -a, -um
- summus, -a, -um
- tantus, -a, -um


## Genitive of Measurement

> fossa **quindecim pedum**

_a ditch **of fifteen feet**_

> vallum **novem pedum**

_a wall **of nine feet**_

> rēx **trīgintā annōrum**

_a king **of thirty years**_

The adjective in these uses is the number.

There is also an ablative of description that is very similar and often interchangeable.  

| genitive | ablative |
| --- | --- |
| vir **summī ingeniī** | vir **summō ingeniō** |
| _a man **of highest genius**_ | _a man **of highest genius**_ |

The ablative is more common than the genitive, and that physical characteristics are better relayed with the ablative.
