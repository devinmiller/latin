# Rule 9: Subject Verb Agreement

A conjugated verb will have the same <span style="color: limegreen">_number_</span> and <span style="color: limegreen">_person_</span> as its subject.

Fairly straightforward as from a few peculiarities:

 - The relative pronoun takes number/person from its antecedent.

 > <span style="color: limegreen">ego</span> sum <span style="color: limegreen">quī</span> fēc<span style="color: limegreen">ī</span>

 _I am the one who did it._

 - Double subjects take a plural verb.

 > <span style="color: magenta">pater</span> et <span style="color: magenta">mater</span> mortuī <span style="color: magenta">sunt</span>

 _His father and mother are dead._

 - Double subjects acting as a single entity _do not_ take a plural verb.

 > Senatus populusque Romanus <span style="color: yellow">intelligit</span>.

 _The senate and Roman people understand._

 - Latin prefers 1st to 2nd person, 2nd to 3rd person.

 > tū et ego <span style="color: magenta">sumus</span> discipulī

 _You and I are students._
