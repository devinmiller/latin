# Rule 50: The Ablative of Manner

_Manner_ is expressed by the ablative case, usually with the preposition _cum_.

Manner is how an action is done.  

> **cum celeritāte** advēnit

_she arrived **with speed**_

> **cum sapientiā** loquēbatur

_he spoke **with wisdom**_

When there is adjective with the ablative, Latin likes to omit the _cum_ preposition.

> **magnā cum sapientiā** loquēbatur

or

> **magnā sapientiā** loquēbatur

Either is valid for the translation.

_he spoke **with great wisdom**_

> **magna cum cūrā** et **dīligentiā** suōs fīnēs tuentur

_they guard their borders with **great care** and **diligence**_

> id **summā cūrā studiō**que conquīrimus

_we search for it **with fullest care** and **devotion**_
