# Rule 46: Comparisons with Quam

The _comparative_ can be followed by a _quam_, meaning _than_, and the two things compared must be put into the _same case_.

> **Catō** est ēlquentior quam **Cicerō**

_**Cato** is more eloquent than **Cicero**_

Note that both nouns are in the same case here (nominative).

> **tū** es callidior quam **ego**

_**you** are more clever than **I**_

> mālunt **legere** quam **pugnāre**

_they prefer **reading** more than **fighting**_

> plūra dōna **fīliae** quam **uxōrī** dedī

_I gave more gifts **to my daughter** than **to my wife**_

| comparison with quam | ablative of comparison |
| --- | --- |
| used with nouns in _all cases_ <br /> used when the comparative is in the _genitive_, _dative_, or _ablative_ cases | used with nouns in the _nominative_ or _accusative_ cases |

> **senex** est meliōre condiciōne quam **adulēscēns**

**an old man** is in a better position than **a young man**

Notice quam is used because the comparative (meliōre) is in the ablative.  Quam is also frequently used with comparative adverbs.

> **soror** dīligentius labōrat quam **frāter**

_**the sister** works more diligently than **her brother**_
