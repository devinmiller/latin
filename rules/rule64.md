# Rule 64: The Potential Subjunctive

The _potential_ subjunctive is used to suggest a _possible_ or _conceivable_ action.

> **vīvāmus** Rōmae

_**We could live** in Rome_

With the potential, both the present and perfect tenses are used to refer to something in the immediate future.

> **maneās** in vīllā meā

With the present subjunctive _maneās_.

_**You could stay** in my house_

> id **fēceris**

With the perfect subjunctive _fēceris_.

_**You could (might) do** this_

There is no real distinction between the present and perfect tenses here.

> nōn **ausim** id facere

The translation _would_ also works along _could_ and _might_.  

_**I would** not **dare** to do it_

The imperfect tense is used to refer to a possibility that existed in the past.  

> Athēnās **venīret**

_**She might have come** to Athens_

> cēnam coquerēs

The word have is included here to show the past existence of the possibility.  

_**You could have cooked** the dinner_

## With Verbs of Saying, Wishing, or Thinking

Often used in the first person and with verbs of sating, wishing, or thinking.  

> **dīxerem** pauca

Still showing a possible future action with the perfect subjunctive _dīxerem_.

_**I could say** a few things_

> tū **velim** sīc exīstimēs

_**I should want** you to think so_

With these types of saying, thinking, or wishing verbs the second person is also seen used in an _indefinite_ sort of way.

> **crēdās** victōs

_**You would think** that they were defeated_

> **dīcerēs** innocentēs

_**You could have said** that they were innocent_

## With Forsitan 

The word _forsitan_, which means _perhaps_, often accompanies the potential subjunctive.  

> forsitant **occurat** illud

_That **might** perhaps **occur_

> forsitan temerē **fēcerim**

_**I might** perhaps **have acted** rashly_
