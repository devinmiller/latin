# Rule 8: Case, Number, and Gender of the Relative Pronoun

The relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in <span style="color: limegreen">_gender_</span> and <span style="color: limegreen">_number_</span>, but its <span style="color: limegreen">_case_</span> depends on how it's used in the relative clause.

| qui, quae, quod | who, which, that |
| --- | --- |
| Nom. | who |
| Gen. | whose, of whom |
| Dat. | to/fo whom |
| Acc. | whom |
| Abl. | by/with/from/ whom |

The <span style="color: cyan">relative clause</span> is the clause of the relative pronoun.

> pontem, <span style="color: limegreen">quī erat ad Genāvam</span>, iubet rescindī

_He orders the bridge, <span style="color: limegreen">which was near Geneva</span>, to be cut down.

The <span style="color: cyan">antecedent</span> is the word to which the pronoun refers.

Who's the <span style="color: limegreen">who</span>?
What's the <span style="color: limegreen">which</span>?

> ea <span style="color: limegreen">diēs</span>, quam constituerat, vēnit

_That <span style="color: limegreen">day</span>, which he had decided upon, came._

| Rules |  |  | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| antecedent | gender and number | <span style="color: limegreen">diēs</span> - feminine singular <br /> <span style="color: limegreen">pons</span> - masculine singular | <span style="color: limegreen">quam</span> - feminine singular <br /> <span style="color: limegreen">quī</span> - masculine singular |
| relative clause | case |  <span style="color: limegreen">quī</span> - nominative <br /> <span style="color: limegreen">quam</span> - accusative |

If the relative pronoun has two antecedents, it receives number and gender just like an adjective.

> <span style="color: cyan">fīlium et fīliam</span>, <span style="color: limegreen">quōs</span> valdē dīlexit, ūnō tempore āmīsit.

_At one time, he lost <span style="color: cyan">his son and daughter</span>, <span style="color: limegreen">whom</span> he loved very much._

> <span style="color: cyan">Aduatucī</span>, dē <span style="color: limegreen">quibus</span> suprā dīximus, domum revertērunt

_<span style="color: cyan">The Aduatucī</span>, about <span style="color: limegreen">whom</span> we have spoken above, returned home._

> Ō <span style="color: cyan">fortunātī</span>, <span style="color: limegreen">quōrum</span> iam moenia surgunt!

_O <span style="color: cyan">fortunate ones</span>, <span style="color: limegreen">whose</span> walls now rise._
