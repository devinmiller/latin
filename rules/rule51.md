# Rule 51:The Ablative of Accompaniment

_Accompaniment_ is indicated by the preposition _cum_ and the ablative.

The ablative with _cum_ can also be used to show accompaniment, such as who a person is traveling with. 

> **cum parentibus** iter faciēbat

_she traveled **with her parents**_

> **cum lēgātūs** vēnit

_he came **with the ambassadors**_

> **cum fēbrī** domum rediit

_he came home **with a fever**_

> obsēdērunt cūriam **cum gladiīs**

_they attacked the senate house **with swords**_

When _cum_ is used with a personal, reflexive, or relative pronoun it is regularly placed after the pronoun as an enclitic.

> **mēcum** ambulābat

_she was walking **with me**_

There are four sub categories to the ablative of accompaniment.

1. companionship

> **cum proximīs cīvitātibus** pācem cōnfirmant

_they make peace **with the states nearby**_

2. dealing

> **cum Caesare** ēgit

_he pleaded **with Caesar**_

3. comparison

> haec **cum illā** nōn comparanda est

_this must not be compared **with that**_

4. fighting

> **cum hoste nostrō** saepe pugnāvit

_he often fought **with our enemy**_
