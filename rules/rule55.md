# Rule 55: The Ablative of Respect/Specification

The ablative case us used to show _in what respect something is done_.

The ablative of respect and specification are one in the same.  

> Hī omnēs **linguā**, **institūtīs**, **lēgibus** inter sē differunt

_All of these (people) are different between themselves **with respect to their language**, **institutions**, and **laws**._

Here the ablatives give the more specific ways in which the groups are different.  

> Helvētiī reliquōs Gallōs **virtūte** praecēdent

_the Helvetians surpass the rest of the Gauls **in their virtue**_

The virtue is the specific bit of information with which these people are supposedly better.  With _respect_ to their virtue.

> oppida **numerō** ad duodecim

_towns about twelve **in number**_

About twelve _in respect_ to the number.

> **corpore** senect esse poterit, **animō** numquam erit

_he may be old **in body**, but he never will be old **in his mind**_

With _respect_ to his body and his mind.  Show the _specific_ aspects in which he will be old and never old.

There are many expressions that are ablative of respect in form: 

- **meā sententiā**, _in my opinion_
- **nullō mōdō**, _in no way_
