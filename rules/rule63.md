# Rule 63: The Deliberative Subjunctive

The _deliberative_ subjunctive is used in questions that suggest _doubt_, _indignation_, or an _impossibility_.

The deliberative, found in questions, is easily separated out from the other independent uses of the subjunctive.

> quid **faciāmus**?

By using _should_ in the translation we invoke the sort of doubt that is inherit in the subjunctive.

_What **should we do**?_

> quid **agam**, iūdicēs?

_What **should I do**, judges?_

> etiamne eam **salūtem**?

_**Should I greet** her?_

> **ēloquar**, an **sileam**?

_**Should I speak**, or **should I be silent**?_

Past tense subjunctives are also used with the deliberative.

> quid dīcerem?

The translation presents a sense of indignation.

_What **was I to say**?_

or

_What **should I have said**?_
