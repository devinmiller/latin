# Rule 25: The Dative of Indirect Object

The _dative case_ is used for the _indirect object_.

This is the main use of the dative case.  Indicates the noun that is indirectly affected by the action of the verb.  

## With Verbs of Motion

Sometimes a verb of motion will use a dative instead of a prepositional phrase, when merging the idea of motion in with something else.

_the province fell by chance **to Cicero**_

> **equō** nē crēdite
