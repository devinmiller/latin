# Rule 49: The Ablative with opus and ūsus

The words **opus** and **ūsus**, when signifying need, take the ablative case.

- opus, operis, _to work_
- ūsus, ūsūs, _to use_

Each of these words also carry a second definition of _need_ with it, and is often used with _est_, or other words, to mean _there is a need_ or _it is necessary_.  

> opus est **magistrātibus**

_there is a need **for magistrates**_

or 

_magistrates are needed_

> nunc **vīribus** ūsus est

_now there is a need **for strength**_

> nunc **manibus rapidīs** ūsus est

_now there is a need **for swift hands**_

_opus est_ can also take an ablative perfect participle by itself.  

> **matūrātō** opus est

_there is a need **to hurry**_

> sī quid opus **factō** esset

_if there were any need **for action**_
