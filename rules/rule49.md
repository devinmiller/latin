# Rule 49: The Ablative with opus and ūsus

The words **opus** and **ūsus**, when signifying need, take the ablative case.

- opus, operis, _to work_
- ūsus, ūsūs, _to use_

Each of these words also carry a second definition of _need_ with it, and is often used with _est_, or other words, to mean _there is a need_ or _it is necessary_.  

> opus est **magistrātibus**

_there is a need **for magistrates**_

or 

_magistrates are needed_

> nun **vīribus** ūsus est

_now there is a need **for strength**_
