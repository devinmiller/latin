# Rule 48: The Ablative with PUFF-V Deponents

the deponents _ūtor_, _fruor_, _fungor_, _potior_, and _vēscor_, and their compounds, take their objects in the ablative case.

These five deponents take an ablative of means for their objects.

- potior, potīrī, _to get, obtain_
- ūtor, ūtī, _to use_
- fruor, fruī, _to enjoy_
- fungor, fungī, _to perform_
- vēscor, vēscī, _to feed upon, eat_

> **gladiīs hastīs**que ūtimur

_we use **swords** and **spears**_

> hērōs **aurō** potitur

_the hero takes the **gold**_

> sī vēscitur **aurā aetheriā**

_if he feeds upon **the upper air**_

> fungar **inānī mūnere**

_I will perform **this useless duty**_

> **lacte** et **carne** vēscēbātur

literally

_she fed herself **with milk** and **meat**_

more more simply

_she ate **milk** and **meat**_
