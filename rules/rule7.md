# Rule 7: Possessive Adjectives and the Genitive

When you have a _possessive adjective_, you can also have a noun in the _genitive_ case to further describe the adjective.

> **nostra** urbs

_**our** city_

> nostra **omnium** urbs

_the city **of** us **all**_

Start with a noun (_town_) and a possessive adjective (_my_).

> **my** town

We want to describe the pronoun that this adjective suggests a bit more.  So we put the adjective into the genitive case and it agrees in case, number, and gender with the _implied pronoun_.  

> my town **of** (_me_) **alone**

Since the genitive pronoun cannot be used for possession the idea of possession is taken up by the possessive adjective.

> meā causā

_for my sake_

> meā **solīus** causā

_for my sake **alone**_

> in nostrō flētū

_in our weeping_

> in nostrō **omnium** flētū

_in the weeping **of** us **all**_

> suum regnum

_his kingdom_

> suum **ipsīus** regnum

_his **own** kingdom_
