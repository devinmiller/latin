# Rule 27: The Dative with Compounds

Many verbs compounded with _ad, ante, con, in, inter, ob, post, prae, prō, sub, super_, and something _circum_ and _rē_ take the _dative case_.

- ad, ante, con
- in, inter, ob
- post, prae, prō
- sub, super
- _sometimes_ circum and rē

When one of these prefixes is used and changes the meaning of the verb _significantly enough_, the object is put into the dative case rather than the accusative.

> **lelgiōnī** *prae*sum

_I am in charge of **the legion**_

> nātūra hominis **pecudibus** *ante*cēdit

_a person's nature is superior **to beasts**_

Also applies to the adjective obvius, obvia, obvium, _meeting, to meet_ and the adverb obviam, _in the way, towards_.

> **mihi** obviam vēnistī

_you came to meet **me**_

> obviī **hostibus**

_when meeting **enemies**_
