# Rule 58: Time with the Ablative and Accusative

The _time at or within which_ something happens is noted by the ablative case, while _duration of time_ is noted by the accusative.

## Ablative of Time when

To show _when_ something happens we use the ablative case.

> **diē septimō** pervēnit

_she arrived **on the seventh day**_

> **quotā horā**?

***at what hour***?

> **prīmā lūce**

***at first light***

All of these examples have nouns with meaning relating to time.  Words that denote event can also be put into the ablative.

### With Prepositions

There are cases where a preposition is used to denote time, such as a time of life.

> in **pueritiā**

_in **boyhood**_

If an adjective is added to modify the noun, the preposition is pushed off.

> **extrēmā pueritiā**

***at the end of boyhood**

The preposition _in_ is also used when talking about an office.

> in **consulātū meō**

> in **my consulship**

But again, an adjective modifier can push off the preposition.  

> **quartō consulātū**

***in his fourth consulship***

Word talking about general situations use a preposition.

> in **cīvīlī bellō**

_in **a civil war**_

However, in specific situations or times the preposition goes away.

> **Secundō Pūnicō Bellō**

***in the Second Punic War***

## Ablative of Time Within Which

The ablative case is also used to show the time within which something happened.  Establishes a broad limit or location.  The time within which is usually found in the plural.

> **tribus proximīs annīs**

***within the last three years***

> **diēbus vīgintī quinque** aggerem extrūxērunt

_they built a mound **within twenty-five days**_

Sometimes this use will have the preposition _in_ as well.

> in **diēbus proximīs decem**

_within **the next ten days**_
