# Rule 30: The Dative of Reference

The dative often depends on the _general meaning_ of the sentence when it's the _dative of reference_.

The dative of reference is often known as the _for_ translation of the dative case.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

The dative shows the person or thing that receives the benefit of the action.

> Graecī **deīs** templa aedificābant

_The Greeks used to build temples **for the gods**_

> **tibi** arō

_I am plowing **for you**_

> mactāvit taurum **Neptūnō**

_he sacrificed a bull **to Neptune**

The lack of a dative of indirect object will leave a sentence hanging, while the lack of a referential dative does not.

## Modify an Idea

The dative of reference can be used to modify a whole idea, in contrast to the genitive of possession which modifies just a single word.


> versātur **mihi** ante oculōs

literally:

_it comes **to me** before the eyes_

translated:

_it comes before **my** eyes_

## Point of View

The dative of reference can be used to show the point of view.

> Platō **mihi** ūnus īnstar est centum mīlium

_**In my opinion**, Plato alone is worth a hundred thousand_

## Exclamations or Interjections

> vae **victįs**

_Woe **to the conquered**
