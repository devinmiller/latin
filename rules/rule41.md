# Rule 41: The Ablative of Separation

Words that signify _seperation_ take the ablative case.

## Seperative Ablative

Original use of the ablative.

### With verbs meaning to _remove_, _set free_, _etc_.

> līberāmur mortis **mētū**

_we are freed **from the fear** of death_

> **dōnīs** prīvātus sum

_I was depreived **of my gifts**_

> canis solūtus **catēnā**

_the dog, release **from his chain**_

Sometimes with a preposition.

> nāvem **ā lītore** solvērunt

_they freed the ship **from the shore**_

Sometimes the verb appears to take the ablative as its object (as it appears in English).

> **sapientiā** caret

_He lacks **wisdom**_

Often seen with _careo_ and _egeo_.

> **bibliothēcīs Graecīs** egēbimus

_we will be in need of **our Greek books**_

### Wth verbs prefixed with _ab_, _dē_, or _ex_

> causae īrārum exciderant **animō**

_the reasons for her anger had not yet fallen **from her mind**_

> **caelō** **dē**mittitis imbrem

_you send down rain **from the sky**_

The general rule is when the verb is used in a figurative or metaphorical sense the preposition is omitted.  The literal use of the verb expects repeating the preposition.

> **ab**īre **magistrātū**

_to leave **from office**_

Here is the verb is used in a literal sense so the preposition is used.  Not a hard and fast concept though.

> **ab**īre **ā prōvinciā**

_to leave **from the province**_

### Adjectives illustrating _freedom_ or _lack_

> urbs nūda **praesidiō**

_a city naked **of defense**_

> immūnis **mīlitiā**

_free **from military service**_

### Exceptions

Sometimes the genetive case is used instead of the ablative.

> immūnis **curvī aratrī**

_free **from the curved plow**_

There is also a dative of seperation [Rule 31](rule31.md).  Typically the dative is used to show action happening to a person to their disadvantage.

> fūr anulum **tibi** abstulit

_the thief stole a ring **from you**_
