# Rule 11: Yes or No Questions

A simple question that has a _<span style="color: limegreen">yes or no answer</span>_ is formed by adding a -<span style="color: limegreen">_ne_</span> to the end of the first word, usually.

This -_ne_ is referred to as an interrogative particle.  A particle is a word or syllable that serves a grammatical function and isn't easily translatable.  

> est mendax

_He is a liar._

> est<span style="color: limegreen">ne</span> mendax?

_Is he a liar?_ 

> vīs<span style="color: limegreen">ne</span> īre mēcum ad forum?

_Do you want to go with me to the forum?_

The -_ne_ is actually added to the emphatic word, which is usually, but not always the first word.

> is tibi mortem<span style="color: limegreen">ne</span> vidētur aut dolōrem timēre?

_Does he seem to you to fear death or pain?_

Additional examples:

> quem<span style="color: limegreen">ne</span> ego servāvī?

_Did you mean the one whom I saved?

> roga illam: quanta<span style="color: limegreen">ne</span>?

_Ask her: how big?_
